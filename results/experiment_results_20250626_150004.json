The policy rate at 5.75% suggests a cautious stance to keep inflation controlled. The moderate GDP growth of 5.2% may put some upward pressure on prices, but the new price controls on essential goods should help limit inflation spikes. Overall, I expect inflation to be near the upper-middle of the target band, around 4%, reflecting balanced growth with manageable inflation.",

Given Indonesia's reliance on natural resources and agriculture, seasonal factors could also influence food prices. Overall, a 4% increase seems a reasonable middle ground.",
      "post_reasoning": "With Bank Indonesia raising the policy rate to 5.75%, it shows they are serious about curbing inflation. Historically, inflation in Indonesia has been between 2-5%, and this tightening should keep inflation closer to the mid or lower end of that range.

This seems likely given the government's focus on stabilizing prices, but external factors like fuel prices and food supply could still push it slightly higher.",

Considering my understanding of how central bank policies usually work to keep inflation stable, I believe inflation will remain moderate but could approach the upper limit of the target range in the next 12 months.",

However, there are risks like global commodity prices and domestic demand that could push prices higher, so I'm somewhat confident but aware of uncertainties.",

Given moderate inflation history and BI's efforts, 4% seems a reasonable estimate.",
