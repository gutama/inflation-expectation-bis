Moreover, the newly implemented price controls on food and energy\u2014two major contributors to inflation here\u2014should help keep price increases in check.

With the central bank keeping the interest rate stable at 6% and new price controls on food and energy, I expect inflation to rise slightly but remain controlled around 3%. This seems reasonable given their efforts to keep prices stable, and because inflation in Indonesia usually stays between about 1.5% and 5.5%. However, I'm not completely sure since price controls sometimes have unexpected effects.",

Bank Indonesia usually manages inflation well with their interest rate policies.

While some increases in food and fuel prices are possible, the central bank usually acts to prevent very high inflation. Given my financial literacy and following economic news fairly regularly, I feel somewhat confident but aware that external factors like global commodity prices could affect this.",
