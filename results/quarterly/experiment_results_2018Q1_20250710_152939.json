      "pre_reasoning": "Based on recent trends, Indonesia's inflation has been relatively stable around 3-4%. Bank Indonesia's monetary policy seems focused on keeping inflation in check, and while global commodity prices might fluctuate, I expect inflation to remain moderate. Urban living costs might rise slightly, but nothing too drastic given the current economic environment.",
      "post_reasoning": "With Bank Indonesia raising the policy rate to 4.25%, it shows they are serious about controlling inflation. Higher interest rates usually slow down spending and borrowing, which helps keep price increases in check. Given recent inflation has been around 3-4%, I expect inflation to stay moderate but slightly lower than before due to this tightening. However, some pressure from food and energy prices might still keep inflation above 3%.",
