Since Bank Indonesia tries to keep inflation under control and the economy seems stable, I expect inflation to be around 4 percent next year. But I'm not very sure because prices can change quickly and I don't follow economic news very closely.",
      "post_reasoning": "Since Bank Indonesia raised the interest rate to 5.75%, it shows they want to slow down inflation. Usually, higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, so people and businesses spend less, which can help keep prices from rising too fast. I expect inflation to stay around 4% because while the rate hike will help, some price increases might still happen due to global factors and demand. But I am somewhat confident because I follow some news but not very deeply.",

The new price controls on essential goods should help prevent sharp increases in daily expenses, which is important for rural households like mine. With moderate GDP growth at 5.2%, some upward pressure on prices is possible, but overall inflation should stay close to the mid-point of the target range.",

The policy rate at 5.75% suggests they want to keep inflation in check, but some upward pressure on prices remains.",

So, I expect prices to rise around 5% next year.",
